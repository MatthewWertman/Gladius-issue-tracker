##### Getting Started
1. Firstly, look for a suitable issue to work on or look in the TODO.txt for tasks.
2. Make sure to fork my repo (link above) and commit your changes.
3. After you are done making changes, create a pull request on my fork and I will look over it.

When making your pull request, make sure to be descriptive about what you changed and the issue or task you did.
